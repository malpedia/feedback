# Malpedia Feedback and Feature Request Tracker

This repository is intended as a public issue tracker to gather feedback for and allow discussions around [Malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de).

## Code of Conduct

Please follow Bill and Ted's great philosophy: [Be excellent to each other](https://mygeekwisdom.com/2011/09/12/be-excellent-to-each-other/). 

## Usage

We have prepared templates for three categories of issues:

 * Bug reports
 * Feature requests
 * Discussions
 
The first two should be self-explanatory. 
Please use Discussions only if the other categories do not fit your concern.

### Please do

 * keep in mind that non-public content on Malpedia is supposed to be handled [TLP:AMBER](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/usage/tos). Review content/screenshots you add to issues with this in mind. 
 * feel free to comment "+1" into issues to signal that you would like to see them handled with priority.

### Please do not

 * open duplicate issues - instead perform a cursory search if your concern fits another issue and "upvote" or comment there.
 * ask for accounts/access to Malpedia -- instead mail us directly: contact(at)malpedia(dot)io, or contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/malpedia).
